Subject: McBuilder Lobbyist

You hear an ominous snicker from behind you as a lobbyist seems to materialize from the shadows.
They snear and extend a gloved hand towards you in the form of a handshake.
You realize by shaking this hand you will receive influence from McBuilder in exchange
for favoring their company for government contracts, and perphaps...part of your soul.
