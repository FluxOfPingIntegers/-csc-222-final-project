# Senator Star

Senator Star is a command line interface game that puts you in the shoes of a senator making various choices. These choices include voting on government contracts, accepting donations from lobbyists, and meeting with other senators. The ultimate goal of the game is to make enough money during 8 turns (4 years) to run for reelection.
